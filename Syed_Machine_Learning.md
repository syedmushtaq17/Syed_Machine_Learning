Hi I am _Syed Mushtaq_ I Love Machine Learning.
***This Repo is about  Machine Learning***


#Machine learning (ML)# is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
It is seen as a subset of [Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).

Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data",in order to make predictions or decisions
without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as > email filtering and > computer vision, 
~~where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.~~
**But Now With the Help of _Machine Learning we can solve these Problems_ .**

Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. 
The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study,
focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.
In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.


###Major Machine Learning Algorithms###

#Regression (Prediction)#
We use regression algorithms for predicting continuous values.
Regression algorithms:

```
* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Exponential Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Logarithmic Regression
```

#Classification#

We use classification algorithms for predicting a set of itemsâ€™ class or category.
Classification algorithms:

```
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine
* Naive Bayes
```
